TV script generation with RNNs

TV Script Generation
In this project, I'll generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

Get the Data
The data is already provided  in this repository in Seinfeld_Scripts.txt and I'm encouraged to open that file and look at the text.

As a first step, I'll load in this data and look at some samples.
Then, I'll be tasked with defining and training an RNN to generate a new script!
